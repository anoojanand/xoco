	<h2>Xoco Wedding</h2>
	<p>In Mayan civilization, hot chocolate would have been the 'champagne' at weddings and special ceremonies. A tradition that we at Xoco feel is in need of revival!</p>
    <p>Chocolate still has a wonderful element of celebration and occasion about it, and we take great care to make all our wedding chocolates a superb and stylish adornment to your special day. Xoco can provide a range of specialist wedding products and services. From our elegantly styled wedding gift boxes and favors, to our unique and distinctive chocolates served as petits fours, we can add a beautiful and delicious moment to your wedding.</p>
